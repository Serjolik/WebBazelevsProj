# Welcome to Bazelevs studio

In this project, we used "Stable diffusion" and "ChatGPT" to create new characters and storyboards with them.

To implement the interface, we used "C#" and "JS".

## About project
In this project, we implemented an interface for generating a description of a character specified by the user and creating images in StableDiffusion based on promt obtained using ChatGPT. It is also possible to get a storyboard. We help film companies that are engaged in the production of cartoons to quickly implement the first stages of creating a character, a script and its storyboard. Thus, artists, screenwriters and animators have more time to make edits and finalize the material. By using our neural network-based product, we offer film companies to save two important resources: money and time.

### 1)
<h5>- Develop a pipeline for automatic storyboarding in a given style based on a text script for a cartoon. The pipeline should use the capabilities of the 3D editor.
</h5>
<h5>- A repository with the project code that can be reproduced on your machine (or in your cloud) by substituting your script.

Generated artbook about the character. </h5>

### 2) our solution:
<h5>- We decided to create a prototype of the service to optimize this task.</h5>

## 3) Our architecture

##  4) Guide 
   <h4>Download the repository, if you have a development environment for C#, run the sln file in the main repository, raise the server. If you don't have a development environment, use docker.</h4> 
  <h4>After starting the server, you will see the home page, go to the manual, there you will see a short description of the tabs.</h4>
