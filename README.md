# Welcome to Bazelevs studio.

In this project, we used "Stable diffusion" and "ChatGPT" to create new characters and storyboards with them.

To implement the interface, we used "C#" and "JS".

## About project:
In this project, we implemented an interface for generating a description of a character specified by the user and creating images in StableDiffusion based on promt obtained using ChatGPT. It is also possible to get a storyboard. We help film companies that are engaged in the production of cartoons to quickly implement the first stages of creating a character, a script and its storyboard. Thus, artists, screenwriters and animators have more time to make edits and finalize the material. By using our neural network-based product, we offer film companies to save two important resources: money and time.

### 1) Formulation of the problem:
<h5>- Develop a pipeline for automatic storyboarding in a given style based on a text script for a cartoon. The pipeline should use the capabilities of the 3D editor.
</h5>
<h5>- A repository with the project code that can be reproduced on your machine (or in your cloud) by substituting your script.

Generated artbook about the character. </h5>

### 2) Our solution:
<h5>- Created interface for generating a description of a character specified by the user and creating images in Stable Diffusion based on prompt obtained using ChatGPT. And also in the future, the implementation of creating a Storyboard with a given character and events to our system.</h5>

## 3) Our architecture:

##  4) Guide: 
   <h4>1. Download the repository <br>
 <br>
 2.<br>
 - if you have a development environment for C#, run the sln file in the main repository and raise the server. <br>
 - If you don't have a development environment, you can use docker in main path to raise the server. <br>
 <br>
 3. After starting the server, you will see the home page, go to the manual, there you will see a short description of the tabs. <br>
 <br>
 4. To use Stable Diffusion you need to download model from other resourse to \stable-diffusion-main\models\ldm\stable-diffusion-v1 <br>
 <br>
 5. To use ChatGPT you need get API Key from OPEN AI and set them to controllers\HomeController (ApiKey param) <br>
